# Timeline for the ESA conference in year X

The major discussion partners are: the program committee chairs, one for each track (PC Chairs), the proceedings chair (PR Chair),
the steering committee chair (SC Chair), and the head of the local organization team (OC Chair). As a default, when writing mails
about any of the general topics below, apart from the specific PC work, put all of them on the list.

## Until September year X - 1

### Find PC Chairs for ESA X

This is the task of the SC Chair and the steering committee.

## Until end of the year X - 1

### Assembly of PC Members

Besides competence, an important aspect is diversity. There should be a good mix of junior and senior people,
a good mix of topics, a good mix of male and female, and a reasonable diversity with respect to affiliations and nationality.
In the last years, the PC for Track A had around 30 members (for around 250 submissions)
and the PC for Track B had around 12 members (for around 50 submissions).

### Call for Papers

The idea is to take the Call for Papers (CfP) from last year and check whether still everything makes sense.
Please pay particular attention to the details of the double-blind reviewing and the [SafeToC](http://safetoc.org) information (new in the CfP for ESA 2021).
The explanations concerning double-blind reviewing should be as clear as possible with respect to the following aspect:
It is allowed (and quite frequently the case) that authors submit papers that have been published on websites, online archives, or non-peer-reviewed venues before.
The question whether and how this fact should be made explicit in the submission.
There are two conflicting arguments:
When the fact is made explicit, information about the authors is disclosed (but note that the exact set of authors may differ).
When the fact is not mentioned, reviewers might inadvertently and mistakenly identify the submission as plagiarism.

### Keynote speakers for ESA X

There are always two keynote speakers for ESA.
This should be discussed and decided together by the PC Chairs, the SC Chair and the OC Chair.
Again, diversity is important.
As a rule, it would be good to always have at least one speaker from an underrepresented group.
The budget is up to the OC Chair.

### Dates for the submission process

There are three important constraints.
The first constraint is the notification deadline of ICALP.
In the past years, the submission deadline for ESA has always been *after* the notification deadline for ICALP (usually a week or so).
The second constraint is the time required for the rewiewing process (from bidding to notification).
The typical duration in the last years was 6 - 8 weeks.
The third constraint is the beginning of the conference (usually early September, but sometimes also late August).
There is time needed to receive the final versions and compile the (online) proceedings.
The proceedings should be ready when the conference starts.

### Have a first version of the website ready

The website is created and maintained by the OC Chair, but it should be filled in cooperation with the PC Chairs.
A first version of the ALGO website should be there as soon as possible.
There should be a dedicated tab for ESA and for each sattelite conference or workshop.
It is OK when all kinds of information is missing, but it is just good to know whatever information is already known.
The domain of the website should be `algoYYYY.<subdomain>.<country code>`.
The setup should be such that the website is still available in ten or twenty years from now.
Look at the websites of previous ALGO for inspiration: imitate the good aspects and improve the others.
